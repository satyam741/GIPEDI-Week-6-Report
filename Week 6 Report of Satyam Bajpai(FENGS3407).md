### <u>Tasks Completed</u>

- ### Weekly Meet with Prof. Kumar & Project on PCA Antennas for emission and detection of THz frequency signals 

  

  - Since I was sick last week, so my weekly meeting with Prof. Kumar was postponed to 26 June 2021, and as guided by Prof. Kumar I added few more pages in presentation that I am supposed to give on 26 June 2021 itself.
  
  - Had weekly meet with Prof. Kar on 18 June 2021 where I learnt the use of software like Project Libre. 
  
  - Got to know about Quotation that a company submits before accepting a project from a client, also learnt about DPR: Detailed Project Report that a company make for every project.
  
  - Below I have attached Image & Link of PDF in which I have covered tasks and timelines of current GIPEDI Internship using Project Libre:

| ~~Coriander Seeds~~     Holy Basil 2.0 | <img width="1930" height="400" src="https://github.com/satyam741/GIPEDI-Week-6-Report/blob/main/HolyBasil%202.0.jpg?raw=true" style="zoom:80%;" /> | After monitoring closely, I found an interesting thing, instead of getting a Coriander Plant in the pot where I have sown coriander seeds, the plant which is growing in the pot is actually Holy Basil, it might be due to prior presence of Basil seeds in the soil & the Basil seeds might have absorbed nutrients and water from the soil more efficiently then coriander seeds. So, coriander seeds were not able to germinate. Height: 3.5 cm |
